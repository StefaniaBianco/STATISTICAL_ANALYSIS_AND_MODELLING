# Introduction and Data Description 

Life quality in cities is a major discussion topic nowadays in the European countries, and the focus of the influence of the environmental aspect is getting more and more important. 
Italy, on its side, is struggling to reach some good environmental index and indicators: furthermore, the complex socio-economical situation throughout the peninsula may underlie some differences among the Nord, Centre and South. 
The present project aims both at:

- understanding the overall state of art of six environmental parameters in the whole Italy;
- analysing and understanding if the parameters are significantly different between the three macroareas of the peninsula.

Data have been collected from "Il Sole 24 Ore" website and GitHub account. The newspaper ranks every year all the 107 Italian provinces from the highest to the lowest for quality of life standards. 
The results are published in an user-friendly website in form of a general and specific ranking, and in the GitHub profile, from where the present data have been taken and imported by using the function:

```{r, eval=FALSE }
getwd()
df <- read.csv("C:/Users/Utente/Desktop/STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND MODELLING/exam/project/20221213_QDV2022_001 (4).csv", dec=".", sep=",", stringsAsFactors = T)
```

Secondarily to the data import, the variables "Province", "Province code", "Cycling lanes", "Motorization rate", "Urban green", "Air quality", "Pedestrian areas", "Urban ecosystem" have been selected. 
These latter have been listed by using the R function "order" according to the province code. 
Finally, a new data frame has been created, called "newdf", and all the variables have been renamed in English. 

For the indicators selection the following code has been used:
```{r, eval=FALSE }
#Example of data cleaning and ordering for one indicator
Piste_ciclabili<-df[df$INDICATORE=="Piste ciclabili", c(1,3,5)]
Piste_ciclabili<-Piste_ciclabili[order(Piste_ciclabili$CODICE.PROVINCIA.ISTAT..STORICO.),]
```

Every indicator has a different unit of measurements: 
- "Cycling lanes" is expressed in equivalent metres every 100 inhabitant;
- "Motorization rate" in number of circulating cars every 100 inhabitants; 
- "Urban green" is squared metres per inhabitant;
- "Air quality" is an index based on PM10, NO2 and O3 data in the regional county seats; 
- "Pedestrian areas" is expressed in squared metres per inhabitant;
- "Urban ecosystem" is an indicator that merged 18 environmental parameters (such as waste recycling, water consumption and public local transportation).
In the present study, the 107 Italian provinces represent the observed statistical units while the environmental parameters are quantitative continuous variables.

The new data frame has been then further divided into three new subsets: 
- North, 
- Centre, 
- "Mezzogiorno" or South,
according to the ISTAT division of the Italian administrative territory.

A descriptive and inferential statistical analysis of all the chosen indicators has been made and it will be explained in the next paragraphs. 
For the descriptive part, a first study of all the indicators was made using:
- measures of central tendency;
- measures of variability;
- plots and graphics to visually appreaciate the data analysis. 
Note that different analysis have been made for the different variables in order to obtain a more dynamic and smooth report. 

Moreover, four correlations between variables have been made, willing to understand if any possible relationship among them could exist.

Finally, for the inferencial part, some tests have been made about the differences among population means, assuming that our data come from a random sample of cities and expanding our inference to the whole geographical area (North, Centre, South).

# Descriptive statistics

In order to make some univariate descriptive analysis, for each indicator the mean, the variance, the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation has been calculated. 
For some variables graphics, such as boxplots, barplots and histograms, have been drawn.  

### Urban green
The first analyzed variable is "Urban green", expressed in squared metres per inhabitant. 
As first numerical measure a data summary has been made in order to calculate the arithmetic mean for each indicator in different areas. 

For "Urban Green", the results are the following:
```{r, eval=TRUE }
mean_urban_green<-mean(newdf$`Urban green`)
mean_urban_green
mean_urban_green_nord<-mean(Nord$`Urban green`)
mean_urban_green_nord
mean_urban_green_centro<-mean(Centro$`Urban green`)
mean_urban_green_centro
mean_urban_green_mezzogiorno<-mean(Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`)
mean_urban_green_mezzogiorno
```
As the barplot shows,the values differ across the peninsula, with a higher mean in the North than the Centre and the South.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
mean_urban_green_values<-c(22.40, 29.79, 19.87, 14.74)
bp_mean_urban_green<-barplot(mean_urban_green_values, 
                                 names.arg = c("Italy", "North", "Centre", "South"), 
                                 col="light green", ylab="m^2 per inhabitant")
title("Barplot of Urban green")
abline(h=22.40)
```

To visualize the quantiles, median, and range of the Italian data, a boxplot has been generated. 
It revealed the presence of five outliers (Gorizia, Pordenone, Verbano-Cusio-Ossola, Monza e Brianza, Reggio Emilia). 
Consequently, we opted to display the boxplot excluding these outliers.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(newdf$`Urban green`, main = "Boxplot of Urban green", ylab = "m^2 per inhabitant", outline = FALSE)
boxplot(newdf$`Urban green`, main = "Boxplot of Urban green", ylab = "m^2 per inhabitant")
```

The presence of these outliers skews the mean. In this case a more robust measure is the median.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
median_urban_green<-median(newdf$`Urban green`)
median_urban_green
```

Measures of variability have also been calculated: variance, standard deviation and coefficient of variation.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Variance of Urban green
variance_urban_green<-mean(newdf$`Urban green`^2)-(mean_urban_green)^2
variance_urban_green
variance_urban_green_nord<-mean(Nord$`Urban green`^2)- (mean_urban_green_nord)^2
variance_urban_green_nord
variance_urban_green_centro<-mean(Centro$`Urban green`^2)-(mean_urban_green_centro)^2
variance_urban_green_centro
variance_urban_green_mezzogiorno<-mean(Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`^2)- (mean_urban_green_mezzogiorno)^2
variance_urban_green_mezzogiorno
```

In the northern region, the variance is notably higher compared to other values, primarily because outlier provinces are concentrated in that area.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Standard deviation of Urban green 
sd_urban_green<-sqrt(variance_urban_green)
sd_urban_green
sd_urban_green_nord<-sqrt(variance_urban_green_nord)
sd_urban_green_nord
sd_urban_green_centro<-sqrt(variance_urban_green_centro)
sd_urban_green_centro
sd_urban_green_mezzogiorno<-sqrt(variance_urban_green_mezzogiorno)
sd_urban_green_mezzogiorno

# Coefficient of variation of Urban green 
cv_urban_green<-sd_urban_green/mean_urban_green
cv_urban_green
cv_urban_green_nord<-sd_urban_green_nord/mean_urban_green_nord
cv_urban_green_nord
cv_urban_green_centro<-sd_urban_green_centro/mean_urban_green_centro
cv_urban_green_centro
cv_urban_green_mezzogiorno<-sd_urban_green_mezzogiorno/mean_urban_green_mezzogiorno
cv_urban_green_mezzogiorno
```

### Air quality
For the variable "Air quality" the unit of measurement is an index based on PM10, NO2 and O3 data in the regional county seats. 
The values obtained for the arithmetic mean are:

- Italy = 51.32, 
- North = 62.41, 
- Centre = 43.83, 
- South = 41.95.

This shows the air quality is in average higher in the South, followed by the Centre and the North in the end.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
mean_air_quality_values<-c(51.32, 62.41, 43.83, 41.95)
bp_mean_air_quality<-barplot(mean_air_quality_values, 
                                 names.arg = c("Italy", "North", "Centre", "South"), 
                                 col="light green", ylab="Index based on PM10, NO2 and O3 data")
title("Barplot of Air quality")
abline(h=51.32)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
boxplot(newdf$`Air quality`, main = "Boxplot of Air quality", ylab = "Index based on PM10, NO2 and O3 data", ylim=c(10,90))

```

To gain a deeper understanding of the air quality across various regions of Italy, an analysis on the grouped frequency distribution has been done pertaining to different levels of the PM10, NO2, and O3 indices in the regional county seats. 
The data have been segmented by using the function "cut" into five classes: 
- "very poor" (20-34), 
- "poor" (34-48), 
- "medium" (48-62), 
- "good" (62-76), 
- "very good" (76-90).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
air_quality_rate_cat<-cut(newdf$`Air quality`, breaks = c(20, 34, 48, 62, 76, 90), labels = c("very good", "good", "medium","poor", "very poor"))
table(air_quality_rate_cat)

air_quality_rate_cat_nord<-cut(Nord$`Air quality`, breaks = c(20, 34, 48, 62, 76, 90), labels = c("very good", "good", "medium","poor", "very poor"))
table(air_quality_rate_cat_nord)

air_quality_rate_cat_centro<-cut(Centro$`Air quality`, breaks = c(20, 34, 48, 62, 76, 90), labels = c("very good", "good", "medium","poor", "very poor"))
table(air_quality_rate_cat_centro)

air_quality_rate_cat_sud<-cut(Mezzogiorno$`Air quality`, breaks = c(20, 34, 48, 62, 76, 90), labels = c("very good", "good", "medium","poor", "very poor"))
table(air_quality_rate_cat_sud)

library(RColorBrewer)
coul <- brewer.pal(5, "Set2")

barplot(table(air_quality_rate_cat), xlab="Index on Pm10, NO2 and O3", ylab="Absolute frequency", ylim = c(0,50), main="Air quality Italy", col=coul, border="black")

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
barplot(table(air_quality_rate_cat_nord), xlab="Index on Pm10, NO2 and O3", ylab="Absolute frequency", ylim = c(0,25), main="Air quality North Italy", col=coul, border="black")
barplot(table(air_quality_rate_cat_centro), xlab="Index on Pm10, NO2 and O3", ylab="Absolute frequency", ylim = c(0,25), main="Air quality Centre Italy", col=coul, border="black")
barplot(table(air_quality_rate_cat_sud), xlab="Index on Pm10, NO2 and O3", ylab="Absolute frequency", ylim = c(0,25), main="Air quality South Italy", col=coul, border="black")
```


As can be observed, a significant number of provinces fall within the first two classes, suggesting a low presence of harmful pollutants. 
However, a lot of provinces still exhibit poor air quality conditions.

An histogram was also created, in order to see more clearly the distribution of the data.
```{r, eval=TRUE}
hist(newdf$`Air quality`, freq=F, xlab="Index on Pm10, nitrogen dioxide and ozone data", ylab="Relative Frequency Density", main="Air quality Italy", col=coul, border="black")
lines(density(newdf$`Air quality`), lwd=2)
abline(v=mean(newdf$`Air quality`), col='red', lwd=3)

curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(newdf$`Air quality`), 
            sd=sd(newdf$`Air quality`)), 
      add=T, col="orange", lwd=2)
```

The black line indicates the density curve, the orange one represents the shape of hypothetically normally distributed data and the red one is the mean.
The histogram is slightly positively skewed.

```{r, eval=TRUE}
shapiro.test(newdf$`Air quality`)
```
To understand if the data are normally distributed or not, Shapiro test can be performed.
The latter test states that: 

- H0 : sample data come from a normal distribution; 
- H1 : sample data do NOT come from a normal distribution.

Since the p-value is really low, strong evidence against H0 can be found, so the data do not come from a normal distribution.

Measures of variability followed a different pattern compared to the mean:
#ricontrollare dati cv
- North: var = 238.60, sd = 15.45, cv = 0.25;
- Centre: var = 50.46, sd = 7.10, cv = 0.16;
- South: var = 126.11, sd = 11.23, cv = 0.27.


# Cycling lane descriptive analysis

The variable "cycling lane" is expressed in equivalent metres every 100 inhabitants. 
The values obtained for the means are:
- Italy = 9.67 
- Nord = 14.90 
- Centre = 7.10 
- South = 4.69

```{r, eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
mean_cycling_lanes_values<-c(9.67, 14.90, 7.10, 4.70)
bp_mean_cycling_lanes<-barplot(mean_cycling_lanes_values, 
                               names.arg = c("Italy", "North", "Centre", "South"), 
                               col="GREEN", ylab="Equivalent metres every 100 inhabitant")
title("Barplot of cycling lanes ")
abline(h=9.67)
abline(h=0)

```

The measures of variability follows the same pattern, with:

- Higher variance and standard deviation in the North (var=99.74, sd=9.99);
- Smaller in the centre (var=36.19, sd=6.02)
- Even smaller in the south (var=35.70, sd=5.98). 

The overall variance for Italy is 86.08, while the standard deviation is 9.28.

To understand from a qualitative point of view if the cycling lane presence is consistent or not in Italy, the range has been calculated. It goes from 0 to 46.5 equivalent meters every 100 inhabitants. 5 categories have been created: 

- "Very poor" = 0-10
- "Poor" = 10-20
- "Medium" = 20-30
- "Good" = 30-40
- "Very good" = 40-50

Note that the above-made classification is based only on the collected data: it is not an arbitrary and universal classification. This means that probably, what has been classified as "very good" could not be good enough for the European standards, or, more generally, for a proper cyclable city.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
range(newdf$`Cycling lanes`)
cycling_lanes_cat<-cut(newdf$`Cycling lanes`, breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), labels = c("Very poor", "Poor", "Medium","Good","Very good"))
table(cycling_lanes_cat)


library(RColorBrewer) #choosing colours
coul <- brewer.pal(5, "Set2")

barplot(table(cycling_lanes_cat), xlab="Equivalent metres every 100 inhabitants", ylab="Number of cycling lanes", main="Cycling lanes Italy", col=coul, border="red")
```

It is clear that the majority of Italian cities have a poor presence of cycling lanes, as more than 60 cities belong to the category "very poor", and the number of cities decreases when the categories get better in terms of presence of cycling lanes. 

To understand how the situation is in the macroregion of Italy, the same process has been applied, but within small subsets. 
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
cycling_lanes_cat_nord<-cut(Nord$`Cycling lanes`, breaks =c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), labels = c("Very poor", "Poor", "Medium","Good","Very good"))
table(cycling_lanes_cat_nord)

cycling_lanes_cat_centro<-cut(Centro$`Cycling lanes`, breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), labels = c("Very poor", "Poor", "Medium","Good","Very good"))
table(cycling_lanes_cat_centro)

cycling_lanes_cat_sud<-cut(Mezzogiorno$`Cycling lanes`, breaks = c(0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50), labels = c("Very poor", "Poor", "Medium","Good","Very good"))
table(cycling_lanes_cat_sud)

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
barplot(table(cycling_lanes_cat_nord), xlab="Equivalent metres every 100 inhabitants", ylab="Number of cycling lanes", ylim=c(0,35), main="Cycling lanes Nord", col=coul, border="red")
barplot(table(cycling_lanes_cat_centro), xlab="Equivalent metres every 100 inhabitants", ylab="Number of cycling lanes", ylim=c(0,35), main="Cycling lanes Centre", col=coul, border="red")
barplot(table(cycling_lanes_cat_sud), xlab="Equivalent metres every 100 inhabitants", ylab="Number of cycling lanes", ylim=c(0,35), main="Cycling lanes South", col=coul, border="red")
dev.off()
```
From this barplots, it can be seen that in the North of Italy there are more cities belonging to better categories compared to the Centre and the South. 

The last analysis made on this variable was an histogram. 
Again, the distribution is strongly positively skewed.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=F}
hist(newdf$`Cycling lanes`, freq=F, xlab="Equivalent metres every 100 inhabitants", ylab="Number of cycling lanes", main="Cycling lanes Italy", col=coul, border="red")
lines(density(newdf$`Cycling lanes`), lwd=2) 
abline(v=mean(newdf$`Cycling lanes`), col='red', lwd=3)
curve(dnorm(x, mean=mean(newdf$`Cycling lanes`), 
            sd=sd(newdf$`Cycling lanes`)), 
      add=T, col="orange", lwd=2)
```

The red line indicates the mean, the black line is the actual density curve and the orange line indicates a normal distributed density curve. 
With the function
```{r, eval=FALSE}
shapiro.test(newdf$`Cycling lanes`) 
```
an extremely low p-value (1.976^-08) has been obtained, meaning strong evidence against H0: data do not come from a normal distribution, as foreseen. 

# Motorization rate descriptive analysis
The variable "Motorization rate" is expressed in circulating cars every 100 inhabitants. The trend this time showed higher values in the South, medium in the Centre and smaller in the North.
The obtained means:

- Italy = 65.54 
- Nord =  62.47
- Centre = 67.40
- South = 68.26

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
mean_motorization_rate_values<-c(65.54, 62.47, 67.40, 68.26)
bp_mean_motorization_rate<-barplot(mean_motorization_rate_values, 
                                   names.arg = c("Italy", "North", "Centre", "South"), 
                                   col="GREEN", ylab="Number of cars per 100 inhabitant")
title("Barplot of motorization rate means")
abline(h=65.54)
abline(h=0)
```

The difference is not that consistent, but still the lower motorization rate in the North of Italy may be due to a better public transportation system, to more cycling lanes in the urban areas and to more pedestrian areas. 

The variance and the standard deviation follow the same pattern:

- Italy var = 45.66; Italy sd = 6.76
- North var = 37.04; North sd = 6.09
- Centre var = 37.37; Centre sd = 6.11
- South var = 40.06; South sd = 6.33

In this case as well a boxplot of the variable "Motorization rate" in Italy has been drawn:
```{r, eval=TRUE}
boxplot(newdf$`Motorization rate`)
```

Once more, the presence of three outliers was noticed: Venice, Genova and Milan.
Overall, the motorization rate is very high and needs to be lowered in order to have more environmental-friendly and human-friendly cities. 

### Pedestrian areas

The index Pedestrian Areas measures the m^2 of pedestrian pavement for every inhabitant.
The results are the following:

- Italy: mean = 0.46, var = 0.72, sd = 0.85, cv = 1.82 
- North: mean = 0.49, var = 0.67, sd = 0.81, cv = 1.70
- Centre: mean = 0.70, var = 1.83, sd = 1.35, cv = 1.21
- South: mean = 0.29, var = 0.082, sd = 0.28, cv = 2.92

In this case, the values obtained from the analysis across the North, Central, and South regions differ significantly. 
While the values for provinces in the North are around the Italian average, those in the South are much lower, whereas those in the Central region are somewhat higher. 
There's also notable variability in the data, particularly in the Central region, indicating a considerable degree of difference among the various provinces.

To visually appreciate the results:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
mean_urban_ecosystem_values<-c(0.53, 0.59, 0.53, 0.46)
bp_mean_urban_ecosystem<-barplot(mean_urban_ecosystem_values, 
                               names.arg = c("Italy", "North", "Centre", "South"), 
                               col="dark green", ylab="Urban Ecosystem Synthetic Index",
                               ylim =c(0, 0.7) )
title("Barplot of Urban Ecosystem")
abline(h=0.53)
```

The "Pedestrian Areas" indicator has been divided in four main categories by using the "cat" function and by looking at the squared metres per inhabitant.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

                                 labels=c("0-1.5", "1.5-3", "3-4.5", "4.5-7"))

The situation is pretty limited all around Italy, with the worst situation again in the South.

```

### Urban ecosystem

Urban Ecosystem is a synthetic index based on 18 parameters: air quality, waste, water networks, land consumption. 
Data have been collected from Legambiente - Environment Italy, 2022.

The obtained values show a shallow pattern across the Italian peninsula; rather, they remain relatively consistent throughout. 
This highlights the need for increased green spaces and urban redevelopment projects throughout the region to make urban areas more environmental-friendly.

The results are the following:

- Italy: mean = 0.53, var = 0.011, sd = 0.10, cv = 0.19 
- North: mean = 0.59, var = 0.008, sd = 0.09, cv = 0.16
- Centre: mean = 0.52, var = 0.007, sd = 0.08, cv = 0.16
- South: mean = 0.46, var = 0.008, sd = 0.09, cv = 0.19

To visually appreciate the results:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
bp_mean_urban_ecosystem<-barplot(mean_urban_ecosystem_values, 
                               names.arg = c("Italy", "North", "Centre", "South"), 
                               col="dark green", ylab="Urban Ecosystem Synthetic Index",
                               ylim =c(0, 0.7) )
title("Barplot of Urban Ecosystem")
abline(h=0.53)
```

For Urban Ecosystem synthetic index, the aim has been to highlight the difference in data density distribution between the North, Center, and South compared to the national Italian average. Therefore, four histograms were created.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=F}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

hist(newdf$`Urban ecosystem`, freq=F, xlab="Synthetic Urban Ecosystem Index", 
     ylab="% of province", ylim = c(0,6),
     main="Urban Ecosystem Northern Italy", col=coul, border="red")
lines(density(Nord$`Urban ecosystem`), col= "blue", lwd=2, ) 
abline(v=mean(Nord$`Urban ecosystem`), col='red', lwd=3)

hist(newdf$`Urban ecosystem`, freq=F, xlab="Synthetic Urban Ecosystem Index", 
     ylab="% of province", ylim = c(0,6),
     main="Urban Ecosystem Central Italy", col=coul, border="red")
lines(density(Centro$`Urban ecosystem`), col= "darkgreen", lwd=2, ) 
abline(v=mean(Centro$`Urban ecosystem`), col='red', lwd=3)

hist(newdf$`Urban ecosystem`, freq=F, xlab="Synthetic Urban Ecosystem Index", 
     ylab="% of province", ylim = c(0,6),
     main="Urban Ecosystem Southern Italy", col=coul, border="red")
lines(density(Mezzogiorno$`Urban ecosystem`), lwd=2, ) 
abline(v=mean(Mezzogiorno$`Urban ecosystem`), col='red', lwd=3)

hist(newdf$`Urban ecosystem`, freq=F, xlab="Synthetic UE Index", 
     ylab="% of province", ylim = c(0,6),
     main="Urban Ecosystem Italy", col=coul, border="red")
lines(density(newdf$`Urban ecosystem`), col= "orange", lwd=2, ) 
lines(density(Nord$`Urban ecosystem`), col= "blue", lwd=2, ) 
lines(density(Centro$`Urban ecosystem`), col= "darkgreen", lwd=2, ) 
lines(density(Mezzogiorno$`Urban ecosystem`), lwd=2, ) 
abline(v=mean(newdf$`Urban ecosystem`), col='red', lwd=3)

legend("topright", inset = c(-0.05, 0), legend= c("Italy","Northern Italy", "Central Italy", "Southern Italy"),
       fill= c("orange", "blue", "darkgreen", "black"), box.lwd= 0.1, cex=0.6, text.width= 0.2, title="Lines legend",
y.intersp = 0.5, text.font = 2, text.col = "black")
```
When it comes to the Northern table, the data density curve is better-positioned compared to the national mean, meaning that the best situation can be found there.
Instead, central region follows the general italian distribution with a good overlap.
Finally, around 5% of Southern provinces have extremely low values, between 0.2 and 0.3. Little more of 50% of them have values ranging between 0.3 and 0.6 with the maximum density around 0.45, which still falls below the national italian mean. Instead, only a small percentage, less than 5% has good values ranging between 0.7 and 0.8.
This confirm what has been previously stated: the situation among the Southern provinces is critical almost everywhere, excluding few cities.

## Correlation between variables
In this section, a study on the correlation between indicators within the dataset was conducted, aiming to identify any potential links between them.

- Air quality and Urban green 
- Pedestrian areas and Motorization rate
- Motorization rate and Cycling lanes
- Urban ecosystem and Air quality

### Air quality and Urban green
It is known that trees may play a central role in improving air quality in cities, so it was expected to get a negative correlation between urban green and the concentration of pollutants and particular matter. 
However, by plotting the two variables together a slightly positive correlation is obtained instead (cor=0.13).
```{r, eval=TRUE}

plot(x=newdf$`Urban green`, y=newdf$`Air quality`,    
     xlab = "Urban Green", ylab="Air quality", 
     main="Scatterplot of Urban Green and Air quality", 
     cex.main=1.4, font.main=2, 
     col.main="orange")
abline(model_italy)
cor(newdf$`Urban green`, newdf$`Air quality`) #cor=0.13    
```
To understand if the correlation is stastically relevant:

```{r, eval=F}
cor.test(newdf$`Urban green`, newdf$`Air quality`)
```
And the p-value obatained is 0.17. In this case: 
- H0 = true correlation is equal to 0;
- H1 = true correlation is not equal to 0.
The p-value does not imply any evidence against H0, so basically the variables are not significantly correlated. 

Also with the functions
```{r}
model_italy <- lm(newdf$`Urban green`~ newdf$`Air quality`)
summary(model_italy)
```
The X^2 is very low, so once more they do not seem to be correlated.

So, is this pattern of "missed correlaton" the same throughout Italy? To understand that, a deepr analysis among subsets has been made.

The results are the following:
- North: very poor correlation (-0.05), that is once more not statistically relevant (p-value=0.71),
- Centre: no significant correlation, 
- South: good negative correlation of -0.44, stastically relevant (p-value=0.005). A strong evidence against the null hypotesis, meaning that for the Southern provinces, the two variables are correlated. 


```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=F}
model_mezzogiorno <- lm(Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`~ Mezzogiorno$`Air quality`)
plot(x=Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`, y=Mezzogiorno$`Air quality`, 
     xlab = "Urban Green", ylab="PM10, NO2 and 03", 
     main="Scatterplot of Urban Green and Air quality", 
     cex.main=1.4, font.main=2, 
     col.main="orange")
abline(model_mezzogiorno)
```

The regression line obtained is: ###MANCA QUALCOSA???????

- Urban Green=50.21-0.56 x [PM10, NO2 and O3 concentration]

However, the coefficient of determination R^2 we obtained with the function lm was 0.20, so our regression line explains only the 20% of the variability of the pollutants concentrations. 

Still, we hypotesized that the more direct correlation between urban green and pollutants in the South is due to a lower presence of factories and industries. Probably, the main emissions in the southern cities are due to traffic, and the pollutants can be more easily absorbed by urban green (when there is a decent amount of threes in the city). 
In the North, probably there are more sources of pollutants that can not be absorbed by urban green, so the correlation is not that direct.

### Pedestrian areas and Motorization rate

As second correlation, we wanted to understand if there is a relationship between the variables "Pedestrian areas" and "Motorization rate". Does an area with more pedestrian areas have less motorization rate?
The scatterplot for the whole Italy is:
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo= FALSE}
model_italy_pa_mr<-lm (newdf$`Pedestrian areas`~newdf$`Motorization rate`)
plot(x=newdf$`Pedestrian areas`, y=newdf$`Motorization rate`, xlab = "Pedestrian areas", ylab="Motorization rate", 
     main="Scatterplot of Pedestrian areas and Motorization rate", 
     cex.main=1.4, font.main=2, 
     col.main="orange")
abline(model_italy_pa_mr)
```

and from the function cor we had a value of linear correlation coefficient r=-0.18. The p-value the function cor.test provided is 0.07, that implies weak evidence against H0.
Againg H0=true correlation is equal to 0, so the two variable may be weakly correlated. The coefficient of determination, however, is pretty low (X^2=0.03), so the regression line would explain only the 3% of the total variability.

Once more, we decided to calculate the correlation within the different geographical areas. 
We started correlating the data from the North of Italy and we actually obtain a r value=-0.39, with a p-value of 0.007 (strong evidence against H0), so the link within this two variable in the North is consistent. 
Furthermore, also the coefficient of determination was higher (0.15). 

About the Centre and the South of the peninsula, we didn't find such clear values: the linear correlation coefficient is almost null for the centre (0.009) and also very low for the South (-0.07).


### Air quality and Urban Ecosystem
A third correlation between the two indicator Air Quality and Urban Ecosystem was made.
The aim was to understand if, whenever a lack of Urban Ecosystem is present, a worst quality of air follows as well.
In this particular case, a consideration must be made: Urban Ecosystem is a synthetic index, based on different indicators (all equally weighted), which one of them is air quality itself. 
So, what is investigated is the impact #####NON MI PIACE QUESTO, COME POSSO SPIEGARLO MEGLIO? that this single indicator has on the final index value.

The results are the following:
- Italy: no general correlation (0.05), the cor test confirms it with the p-value.
- North: a poor negative correlation (-0.3). Though, this value is not statically relevant, because according to the p-value there's no evidene against H0.
- Centre: no correlation (0.06), the cor test confirms it with the p-value.
- South: good negative correlaiton (-0.6), the cor test confirms it with the p-value. 
These can be read as follow: while there's no general correlation throughtout the peninsula, which is confirmed by Northern and Central data analysis, when it comes to the Southern ones, the trend is different.
In fact, a good negative correlation is found, meaning that with the increasing of Urban Ecosystems, the concentration of pm10, O3 and NO2 decreases.
This is probably due to the fact that in the Southern provinces a less massive presence of industries is present and so, the improvement of air quality can be correlated to the increase of Urban Ecosystem.
However, since in this study a "Presence of industries" index is not taken into account, the previous can be seen only as a possible explanation. Further study should be done.

# Inference

For our inferencial analysis, we worked pretending that our provences are stastical units coming from a random sample and assuming we could broaden the results obtained thanks to the values of the main cities to the whole geographical areas.
((((#io scriverei quello della riga precedente al posto di questo, mi sembra più chiaro, però ditemi voi. Our inference work involves sampling provinces within the subset, aiming to confirm and broaden the results obtained during the analysis to the entire population.))))) Given the observed patterns of differences between provinces within the same indicators, our goal is to validate these results through hypothesis testing and subsequently generalize them to whole Italy.

We used the following packages:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(EnvStats)
library(BSDA)
```
and for every subset we performed the Shapiro test in order to understand the normality of our data, and subsequently performing a T test or a Z test. 
We performed the t.test every time we obtained normality in our population data, taking into account the fact that the variance is unknown.
We performed the z.test every time we did not obtain normality in our population data, knowing that we can assume our data follow a ###z distribution in case of large samples (n>30). 
However, the subset of the central Italy has not a sample size large enough (n=22), so we could perform the z test only for comparing the population of the North (n=47) and of the South (n=38) of Italy.

### Inference on the variable "Cycling lanes"

By looking at the data of the variable "Cycling lane", we already noted some important differences among the peninsula. We had already seen the mean values decreases going southern, but we wanted to test if the differences are statistically relevant. 
We first performed the Shapiro test to understand the normality of our subset data. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
shapiro.test(Nord$`Cycling lanes`)
shapiro.test(Mezzogiorno$`Cycling lanes`)
shapiro.test(Centro$`Cycling lanes`)
```
We obtained in all the three cases a low p-value, meaning that all our data come from a non-normal distribution. 
As already stated in the introduction, we can perform the z test even if the variance is unknown if we have a sample size large enough. 
We can in our case make inference on the difference between the population means between the North and the South. 
In order to do the z test, we need to have the standard deviation of the two samples, that we can calculate using the function var() that gives us the unbiased sample variance and the simply using the function sqrt()
```{r, eval=FALSE}
z.test(x=Nord$`Cycling lanes` , y = Mezzogiorno$`Cycling lanes`,
       alternative = "two.sided", sigma.x=10.09, sigma.y=6.06, mu=0, conf.level = 0.99)
```
With this test:

- H0=true difference between population means is equal to 0
- H1=true difference between population means is not equal to 0

We obtained an extremely low p-value (8.17^-09), so we are 99% confident the difference between the amount of Cycling lanes in the North and the South is stastically significative. 

### Inference on the variable "Motorization rate" 

With the variable "Motorization rate" we found an opposite trend: higher values in the South and lower values in the North. 
This time, with the Shapiro test, we discovered the datas in the subset North follow a normal distribution, whereas in the Centre and in the South follow a normal distribution. 
Therefore, we could perform the T test within the difference of means of Centre and South
```{r, eval=FALSE}
t.test(x=Mezzogiorno$`Motorization rate` , y = Centro$`Motorization rate`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, var.equal=T, conf.level = 0.99)
```
but this time obtaining an high p-value (0.6167), implying no evidence against H0, so basically there is not significative difference among these two geographical areas.

### Inferencce on the variable "Urban green"
!!!da finire!!! (xMttia XD)
To find if the distribution is normal in different areas
```{r, eval=FALSE}
shapiro.test(Nord$`Urban green`) #not normal distribution
shapiro.test(Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`) #not normal distribution
shapiro.test(Centro$`Urban green`) #normal distribution
```

We caluclated the unbiased variance and used it for the z.test to understand if the difference between means in nord and mezzogiorno
```{r, eval=FALSE}
var(Nord$`Urban green`)
sqrt(var(Nord$`Urban green`))
var(Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`)
sqrt(var(Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`))

z.test(x=Nord$`Urban green` , y = Mezzogiorno$`Urban green`, alternative = "two.sided",
       sigma.x=24.07, sigma.y=9.02, mu=0, conf.level = 0.99)
#p-value 7,585e-05 so reject H0 (differences between the two means is not equal to 0)

```
since the p-value is really small we can say that we have a strong evidence to reject H0 

### Inferencce on the variable "Pedestrian Areas"
Since the variable pedestrian areas has not a normal distribution, a z-test has been applied for large sample (>30).
This has be successfully done for the Northern and the Southern provinces, but not for the Central one, where n = 22.

# We need to calculate both sigma Y and sigma X, but to do that we need the unbiased sample variance
# so we will use the var function
```{r, eval=FALSE}
Nord_var <- var(Nord$`Pedestrian areas`)
Centro_var <- var(Centro$`Pedestrian areas`)
Sud_var <- var(Mezzogiorno$`Pedestrian areas`)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
Nord_usv <-sqrt(Nord_var)
Centro_usv <-sqrt(Centro_var)
Sud_usv <-sqrt(Sud_var)
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Now we can appyl the z.test on our variable "Pedestrian Areas"
z.test(x=Nord$`Pedestrian areas`, y = Mezzogiorno$`Pedestrian areas`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, sigma.x= Nord_usv, sigma.y= Sud_usv, conf.level = 0.99) # p-value 0.11
z.test(x=Nord$`Pedestrian areas`, y = Centro$`Pedestrian areas`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, sigma.x= Nord_usv, sigma.y= Centro_usv, conf.level = 0.99) #p-value 0.52
z.test(x=Mezzogiorno$`Pedestrian areas`, y = Centro$`Pedestrian areas`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, sigma.x= Sud_usv, sigma.y= Centro_usv, conf.level = 0.99) #p-value 0.17
```

# Instead, when it comes to Urban Ecosystem, since a normal distribution is followed, 
# a t-test can be applied.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
t.test(x=Nord$`Urban ecosystem` , y = Mezzogiorno$`Urban ecosystem`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, var.equal=T, conf.level = 0.99) #4x10^(-8) strong evidence against H0
t.test(x=Nord$`Urban ecosystem` , y = Centro$`Urban ecosystem`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, var.equal=T, conf.level = 0.99) #0.0166 strong evidence against H0
t.test(x=Mezzogiorno$`Urban ecosystem` , y = Centro$`Urban ecosystem`, alternative = "two.sided",
       mu=0, var.equal=T, conf.level = 0.99) #0.009 strong evidence against H0
```
#As expected, H0 is rejected, since our mean values for Urban Ecosystem for North, Centre and South are diffent within eachothers.

# Conclusion

Our project's aim was to understand the Italian situation regarding some environmental parameters and to discover if there are patterns along the Peninsula. 

Overall, the environmental state of the Italian cities can be definitely improved: the indicators underline a #bad situation for all the parameters. 
Furthermore, the gap between North-Centre-South is almost always visible and consistent in every aspect analysed. 

The need of creating sustainable cities, both for human life and from an environmental point of view, is getting more and more urgent. 
Thanks to the indicators we can understand where is more important to act, both in terms of parameters and in terms of geographical area.
